h1. Browser.rb

h2. Usage

From parameters:

<code>macruby browser_rb/browse.rb -u http://www.w3.org</code>

From STDIN:

<code>curl http://www.w3.org | macruby browser_rb/browse.rb -u http://www.w3.org</code>

(the --url parameter allows you to specify the base URL so that assets with relative paths can be retrieved)

h2. Purpose

So you're programming and you have a string of HTML to process. Reading tags can make your eyes bleed. Wouldn't it be easier if we could just pipe some HTML to a browser and view it like normal people? Now you can with browse.rb!

Well, really this is a first step. This is just a sample MacRuby program demonstrating a few things:

# Using WebKit's WebViews from MacRuby.
# Enabling the Javascript development tools.
# Launching an application from the commandline that gets a window and a Dock icon.
